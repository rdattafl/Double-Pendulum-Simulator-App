% Welcome! This function, start.m, is part of my Final Portfolio and can be used to initiate the running of 
% my Double Pendulum Simulator App.

% The Double Pendulum App that I have created allows for the modification of 6 different parameters that are 
% required to generate a unique plot: L1 and L2 (the lengths from the origin to the first bob and from the 
% first bob to the second bob, respectively); M1 and M2 (the masses of the red and blue pendulum bobs, 
% respectively); as well as Theta1 and Theta2 (which are defined as the angle between the y-axis and the 
% first string, and the angle between the first string and the second string, respectively). 

% Use either the Theta1 or Theta2 knobs provided or the text boxes to their right to alter the values of 
% the starting angles. Additionally, use the sliders or the text boxes to change the values of the bobs' 
% masses. Finally, type in a length of your choice to change the first and second string lengths.

% To start the pendulum motion itself, hit either the green "Go (G)" button or press the "G" button on your 
% keyboard, then watch as the pendulum swings across your screen.If you want to start the program over, use either the 
% red "Reset (R)" button or hit the "R" button on your keyboard to bring the double pendulum axes back to 
% its default settings and then even try another unique set of parameters!

% A fun, interesting set of parameters to start with in the Double Pendulum App: (Definitely experiment with any 
% parameters of your choice, though!)
% L1 = 9
% L2 = 6
% M1 = 5.435
% M2 = 2.824
% Theta1 = 2.295
% Theta2 = 1.819
