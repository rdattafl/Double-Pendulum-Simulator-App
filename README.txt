Instructions for Interaction:
The Double Pendulum Simulator App that I have created allows for the modification of 6 different parameters that are required to generate a unique plot: L1 and L2 (the lengths from the origin to the first bob and from the first bob to the second bob, respectively); M1 and M2 (the masses of the red and blue pendulum bobs, respectively); as well as Theta1 and Theta2 (which are defined as the angle between the y-axis and the first string, and the angle between the first string and the second string, respectively). 

Use either the Theta1 or Theta2 knobs provided or the text boxes to their right to alter the values of the starting angles. Additionally, use the sliders or the text boxes to change the values of the bobs' masses. Finally, type in a length of your choice to change the first and second string lengths.

To start the pendulum motion itself, hit either the green "Go (G)" button or press the "G" button on your keyboard, then watch as the pendulum swings across your screen.If you want to start the program over, use either the red "Reset (R)" button or hit the "R" button on your keyboard to bring the double pendulum axes back to its default settings and then even try another unique set of parameters!


Project Intent:
The intent of my project was to create an app that could be run in order to interactively enter and modify various inputs relevant to the construction of a double pendulum (including lengths of two strings, masses of two bobs, and starting angles of the two strings) and then allow the user to click either a "Go" or "Reset" button to change the viewable motion of the double pendulum. 


Project Features: 
My project features an axes element where the double pendulum is graphed and displayed over the entire course of its motion, two buttons that start and reset the double pendulum's motion, editable input boxes for all 6 parameters that edit their respective element of the double pendulum, as well as sliders to dynamically change the masses of the two bobs and knobs to dynamically change the starting angles of the two strings.


MATLAB/Algorithm Skills Applied:
App Development and Testing using AppDesigner, Object-oriented Programming, Numerical Differential Equation Solving (ODE45), Graphics and Animation Techniques (patch, plot, drawnow, hold)
